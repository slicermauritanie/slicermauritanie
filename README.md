# Slicer Mauritanie

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the official GitHub repository for Slicer Mauritanie!

## About Us
We are a passionate team at Slicer Mauritanie, dedicated to contributing to the development and community of 3D Slicer. Our goal is to make 3D Slicer more accessible to a broader audience of users and researchers in the medical field. We believe in the power of open-source collaboration and aim to bring innovative solutions to medical image processing and segmentation.

## Projects

### Anatomy Atlases
- Developed by Professors Idriss and Yahya in 2018.
- Enables medical students to visualize and assimilate human body parts efficiently using 3D Slicer.

### 3D Models of Baby and Expectant Mother Mannequins
- Ongoing project focused on creating 3D models for educational purposes.

### Breast Cancer Segmentation
- Implementation and integration of three breast cancer segmentation methods:
  - Adaptive Fuzzy C-means algorithm.
  - Adaptive K-means algorithm.
  - Adaptive Otsu thresholding.

### Deep Learning in Medical Image Processing
- Ongoing doctoral thesis project involving the processing and segmentation of medical images using 3D Slicer and Deep Learning.
- Part of an integrated approach for analyzing various medical data from Mauritania.

### Future Projects
- Ongoing exploration of cutting-edge techniques in medical image processing and segmentation.
- Anticipation of additional applications to further contribute to the medical community.

## Objectives

### Short-Term Goals
- Complete the generation of 3D models for baby and expectant mother mannequins.
- Successfully integrate the breast cancer segmentation methods into 3D Slicer.

### Long-Term Goals
- Progress the doctoral thesis on the segmentation of medical images from Mauritania.
- Explore and implement advanced techniques in medical image processing, especially those based on Deep Learning.
